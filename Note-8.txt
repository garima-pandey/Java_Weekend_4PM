OOAD: Object Oriented Analysis and Design

- To make your code clean
- OOAD provides SOLID principle

1. Duplicacy in Code
D - DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
copy paste Alternative create a function and call it.

2. Security of the data
Include private member variables

Encapsulation:
Wrap methods and member variables into a single unit is called encapsulation. e.g: class

Data Hiding - Make member variables private - Good Encapsulation
Good Encapsulation: Data Hiding + Encapsualtion

Scopes in Java:

private: with in the class
default: (just concept not keyword) - scope with in the folder(package)
public: access on any package
protected: with in the package but we can access it only outside the package using inheritance


Constructor:

Q: Need to initialize the member variable when object is construct or create.
Ans: We need constructor for this.
Constructor is call when you create an object.
So Constructior will initialize the member variables.
Constructor name is same as class name.
Constructor never return anything.
It is called only once.
One class can have multiple constructors, so this thing is called constructor overloading.
Every class by default have default constructor.
So if you create any other constructor the default one is killed.

1. default constructor
2. parameterized constructor
