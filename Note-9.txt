What is Package in Java?

- Package is a folder behind the scene
- Package is a collection of classes, interfaces
- We divide a big project into small-2 packages
- So we can group the similar nature code in same kind of package

e.g: user package - Login, Register, Password Change, Account Delete

Online Exam System
teacher - package

1. In Development
SOLID
S - SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

One Class One File
If your class is public so class name must be same as file name
So in one file we can have n non public classes
If one file (X.java) has 3 classes
e.g: class X{} class Y{} class Z{}
After compile it will create 3 byte codes
X.class Y.class Z.class
