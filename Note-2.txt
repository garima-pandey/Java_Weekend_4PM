Java:

- Platform Independent
- WORA: Write Once Run Anywhere
- High Level
- Open Source - till Java 11
- OOPS

2 major types of programming:

- procedural - Functions - Divide a problem into functions
- oops - Class - wrap all the variables and methods/functions into a single unit


SetUp Java
JDK
- Javac: Java Compiler
- Java: JRE
- javadoc: java documentation

Java Installation:

1. Download Java 19
2. Set Path in Environment Variables
3. Copy path till bin folder and paste in environment variables

Java SE - Java Standard Edition
Java EE - Java Enterprise Edition


Creating First Java Program:

- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either alphabet or special symbol (_, $)

- Compile the code: javac Filename.java
- Run the code: java classname/bytecodename

javac comes from JDK
java comes from JRE, Now JRE starts searching for main

Main method
- main is a entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code, but it can't exceute the 
	code or interpret the code

4 types of scopes in java

public - global, which is accessible for all from anywhere

why main is public?

- JRE uses main
- java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load your class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from your directory/folder/package

why main is static?
- Static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded

why main is void?
- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything
